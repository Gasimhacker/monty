# Brainfuck Programs

This directory contains Brainfuck programs written by [Gasimhacker](https://github.com/Gasimhacker)
and [A7mdos](https://github.com/A7mdos). Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language known for its minimalistic and unconventional design.

## Contents

1. [1000-school.bf](bf/1000-school.bf): When executed, this program will print the word "School" to the standard output, followed by a newline character.

2. [1001-add.bf](bf/1001-add.bf): This program reads two one-digit numbers from the input, adds them together, and prints the result. The result is guaranteed to be less than 10.

3. [1002-mul.bf](bf/1002-mul.bf): Similar to the previous program, this one multiplies two one-digit numbers read from the input and prints the result. Again, the result is guaranteed to be less than 10.

4. [1003-mul.bf](bf/1003-mul.bf): This program is similar to [1002-mul.bf](bf/1002-mul.bf), but it allows the result to be a two-digit number. Additionally, a newline character is printed after the result.


## Running Brainfuck Code

To run these Brainfuck code examples on a Linux system, you can use the bf interpreter. If you don't have it installed, you can install it by running the following command:


`sudo apt-get install bf`


Once installed, you can execute the Brainfuck code files by passing them as arguments to the bf command. For example:


`bf 1000-school.bf`


This will run the `1000-school.bf` code, and you should see the output `School` followed by a newline.

Please note that Brainfuck is a highly esoteric language and not intended for practical use. It is mainly used for educational and recreational purposes due to its unconventional syntax and limited expressiveness.
